# Rolling Stone Magazine's Top 500 Albums App ğŸ’¿

This is a sideÂ projectÂ created using an [API](https://jamie-albums-api.herokuapp.com/) that I created as part of the Technigo boot-camp. The repository can be viewed on my [GitHub](https://github.com/the-j-curl/project-mongo-api).
The aimÂ wasÂ toÂ have fun buildingÂ a frontend applicationÂ which displays the Top 500 Albums using my own API data from a previous project. I have included a search field which uses the filter method to return an album(s), and a page with extra details on.
